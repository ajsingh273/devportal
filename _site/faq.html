        <h1>FAQs</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Do I need to register?</h3>

<p>Use of our APIs and other data sets is free of charge and allows unlimited access.  For a limited time period, registration to use the APIs is not required.  Starting in 2015, developers will be required to register and receive a development key in order to enjoy free, unlimited access to the the U.S. government’s growing data mart of trade information.</p>

<h3>Are there any data limits for a single application or a developer?</h3>

<p>Currently there are no limits.  However, starting in 2015 we will control and meter traffic associated with an individual API key.</p>

<!-- The default setting will be no more than **X** calls per second and **XXX** calls per day. This threshold can be raised for either a specific API key or globally if needed. We expect to make adjustments to the default settings over time. Our goal is to encourage the development of applications that help exporters. We do not want to introduce any limitations that work against that. -->


<h3>What kind of data can I get from the API?</h3>

<p>Visit the links on the <a href="http://developer.trade.gov">Home page</a> to learn more about the different data sets and their methods.</p>

<h2>Monetization</h2>

<h3>Does ITA charge for this service?</h3>

<p>No. It's completely free.</p>

<h3>Does ITA allow for profit applications that use this data?</h3>

<p>Yes, any application (including those for-profit) are welcome to use the API in any way that they see fit.</p>

<!-- as long as they conform to the [Developer License Agreement](/developer-license.html). -->


<h3>Other than agreeing to a license, do developers need accounts/API keys or other mechanisms?</h3>

<p>No, not at the moment.  Starting in 2015, developers will be required to register and receive a development key.</p>

<!-- Developers need to **register** and get an API key. ITA uses **XXX** to handle registration, API key distribution, and general management of the data flow. -->


<h2>Data Formats</h2>

<h3>What is the format of this feed?</h3>

<p>API data is accessible as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).</p>

<!-- ###I am ready to deploy my application. How can I get my data limits increased?
When you are ready to release your app, please **XXX...** -->


<h2>General</h2>

<h3>Did something change?  My app is not working.</h3>

<p>The ITA API is constantly evolving and we will continually make updates. If you have an application that's no longer working, visit the <a href="change-log.html">Change Log</a> page to see if any updates are affecting it.</p>

<h3>What sort of load are ITA's servers able to handle?</h3>

<p>ITA uses cloud computing, so there is no impact on ITA’s infrastructure.</p>

<h3>How real-time is "real-time"? Is the data updated continuously or is there some sort of delay?</h3>

<p>It will vary based on the type of information requested and the system that it is drawn from. Our goal is to provide the data as close to “real-time” as possible.</p>

<h3>What sort of applications does ITA expect/hope developers will make?</h3>

<p>We get excited for unique and creative applications that provide benefit to businesses that export their products and services overseas.  Applications that share ITA’s resources with a wide audience are particularly desirable.  Visit our <a href="app-gallery.html">Apps Gallery page</a> for ideas.</p>

<h3>Why does ITA offer this data?</h3>

<p>ITA would like to share its valuable resources (data, content, information) with as many businesses as possible.  Our mission is to assist American businesses in planning their international sales strategies and succeed in today’s global marketplace.  <strong>By sharing ITA’s resources, your applications help us help them!</strong></p>
