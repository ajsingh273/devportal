#<a href="market-research-library.html">Apps for Exporters</a>

ITA encourages developers to use the trade data in its APIs to build applications. These data sets are particularly valuable because they originate from authoritative, federal government sources. Developers should build applications that benefit businesses who export their products and services overseas. They can also enhance their existing applications by mashing ITA’s data with other trade-related data.

We are particularly interested in applications that help businesses:

* Learn about exporting
* Get ready to export
* Expand their existing exporting business.

###<a href="">ITA Trade Widgets</a>
ITA has created several widgets that take advantage of the APIs’ search capabilities so you don’t have to.  Visit the [ITA Trade Widgets page](widgets.html) for code that you can immediately add to your Web page or mobile app.

The <strong>Drew Company</strong> created some quick widgets to help their business teams understand the power behind each API.  You too can take advantage of the work they’ve done and explore the code for each search tool yourself.  There’s one for [Market Research](http://sources.drewcompany.com/ita/example.html), [Trade News](http://sources.drewcompany.com/ita/news.html), and [Trade Events](http://sources.drewcompany.com/ita/events.html).

###<a href="">ITA Trade Widgets</a>

Check out some of the newly developed widgets using our APIs. These widgets make Trade data easily accessible to everyone.

To include any of these on your page:

 * Copy the code snippet below the widget
 * Paste the code into the body section of your page
 * That’s it. Now they’re ready to use!
 
These widgets can be used to search by keyword or filter multiple parameters to produce accurate results.

###Trade Articles

The Trade News & Articles API provides in-depth news and articles written by trade specialists working in the Federal government.  This widget enables users to enter a keyword and search all articles for that keyword across the title, body, and tag fields.
