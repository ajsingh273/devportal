#Welcome to the International Trade Developer Portal!

## Overview
Through this site, the Federal government gives software developers access to authoritative information on U.S. exports and international trade via standard APIs.

The data accessible here is targeted at helping U.S. small businesses export and expand their operations in overseas markets. We encourage you to integrate trade data into your applications and mashups to help U.S. small business owners compete overseas while creating jobs at home.

Use of our APIs and other data sets is free of charge and allows unlimited access. For a limited time period, registration to use the APIs is not required. Starting in mid-2014, developers will be required to register and receive a development key in order to enjoy free access to the the U.S. governmentâ€™s growing data mart of trade information.
